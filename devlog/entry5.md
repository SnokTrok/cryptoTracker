# Training an LSTM model agaisnt OHLC historical data...


## Preliminary research

Why use LSTM:

Alternative model approaches:


To begin with I decided to follow along with [this tutorial](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/stock-price-prediction-using-machine-learning#stock_price_prediction) by Avijeet Biswal of which has some good easy to follow explanations of LSTM models for market prediction.

## Overfitting

In ML context overfittting occurs when a model has been trained to closely to the training data supplied to it , meanning it lacks the ability to generalize the results for new incoming data.
